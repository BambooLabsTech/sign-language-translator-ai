      "Yes, based on the analysis, many samples share the same source video URL.\n",
      "This is the standard way sign language datasets are often structured, with different samples being segments from longer videos.\n",
      "Therefore, you **will need to preprocess** the videos by downloading the full video (or parts containing the segments) and then extracting the specific segments defined by the `start_time` and `end_time` for each sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, some source videos are shared across the training, validation, and/or test splits.\n",
      "Be mindful of this potential data leakage when training and evaluating your model. Standard practice might involve ensuring splits are done by *video* rather than by *sample* if possible, though MSASL provides pre-defined splits.\n",
      "Using the provided splits means segments from the same video can appear in different sets. This might require specific evaluation strategies or careful handling if aiming for strict video-based generalization.\n",
      "\n",
      "Within splits, the same URL is often used for samples with *different* labels.\n",
      "This confirms that multiple distinct signs/phrases are being extracted from the same source video within a single split.\n"
